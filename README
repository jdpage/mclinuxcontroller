This code is BSD-licensed, like all of my public code. Enjoy.

This is really rough at the moment, if interest is shown I'll add configuration of some sort. In the meantime, you'll have to edit+recompile to set preferences.

To build (WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS because of the joystick interface I use - Only tested on Linux)

cd path/to/mclinuxcontroller
cmake .
# make any required edits to joykeyd.c
make
./joykeyd
