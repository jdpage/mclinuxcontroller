A little Linux daemon which lets you control Minecraft with a joystick.

It's a quick little hack intended for my own use, and as such you'll have to
edit the source to set preferences.

To build:

    cd path/to/mclinuxcontroller
    cmake .
    # make any required edits to joykeyd.c
    make
	# now you can run it
    ./joykeyd
